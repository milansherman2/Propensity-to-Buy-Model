# Propensity-to-Buy-Model
Binary Classification

Problem: 
The problem that we were trying to solve is predicting whether a user approved for a life insurance policy with Sherman’s company would purchase a policy.  Given that only 30-40% of users who apply for a policy are approved, this is an important group of potential customers for the company to focus on as they’ve already cleared an important barrier to becoming a customer by getting approved.
Implications: 
1.	Being able to predict who will purchase a policy can help to allocate resources in terms of following up with users who are approved but have not bound, i.e., purchased, a policy.  Currently the marketing action that the company is taking with these customers is to have an agent contact the user via phone to follow up and answer questions.  
2.	Knowing the characteristics of users who are likely to bind can guide future marketing and product development.  
I was especially interested in understanding the importance of a particular feature to the model in this project related to how the software generates insurance premium quotes.  I did an analysis that found that more than half of users are shown a higher premium after they are approved than they saw when they generated an instant quote at the start of the process.  By including the difference between these two premiums as a feature in the model and understanding its importance to the accuracy of the model, the company can begin to quantify how this feature is impacting the business and take appropriate action.
